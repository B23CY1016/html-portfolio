<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a student at Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur currently persuing my Bachelor's degree in Chemistry.
   But take a pause! I am not into Chemistry only...:p I am from Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Always want to learn something new.
   I am into development and designing and a bit good at presentation skills. Additionally I am eagerly interested in learning new evolving technologies in Machine learning,
  SQL, NumPy, languages like C, C++, Python, Java, webD frameworks,app development, DSA, Flutter, Django, mastering Excel.
</p>

<p>Whatever I mentioned above is the bucket list for these four graduating years here at IIT Jodhpur. 
  Also to take this harder and new path I always take guidance from my seniors and friends.
   All the people I have in my circle are of very kind, supportive and helping nature. 
  </p>

<p>There are yet many more things to get into with Generative AI!
  These all were my technological requirements. Other than this I am mad at music, arts, drawing, sketching, handycrafts,
  cooking, everything in festivals and many more.
  None of the less I just want to expose myself into everything and not to be an introvert anymore.
  What I follow now is PERMA!
  Want to know? Then reach out to me...:p
